# pyml

#### Description

This is a machine learning library that is currently being developed. I am developing this package while following Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera to cement my understanding of the internals of the models I learn. As such, everything in this package will be implemented using pure python (at least that is the plan for now). 

#### Usage

This package can be installed locally on a users machine using the make commands that will soon be provided.
